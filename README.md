This simple datapack adds a custom loot table to spawners, making them drop loot when broken.

Current possible drops are:
* Gold Ingots
* Iron Ingots
* Emeralds (Overworld only)
* Blaze Rods (Nether only)
* A book, enchanted using the Enchanting Table function, with levels between 10 and 20
* Amethyst Shards
* Lapis Lazuli
